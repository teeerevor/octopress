> Fantastic insight from Neil deGrasse Tyson about how important it is to be sensitive to someone’s current state of mind when you are trying to teach or persuade. You don’t teach with facts alone. You have to understand how those facts/thoughts are received by the person on the other end. And to do that, you have to understand what’s already in their head and how those ideas got there. Teaching is about bringing facts and external sensitivity together to have impact. This is powerful stuff and a great lesson for everyone.
