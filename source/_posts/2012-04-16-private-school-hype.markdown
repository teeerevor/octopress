> If parents think they can isolate their children from others with problem behaviours by sending them to a private school, then they've never been to a private school. In the affluent suburb where I grew up, the troubled teenagers had two identifying characteristics: drugs or alcohol and private schooling.

> If a child comes from a deeply dysfunctional home, no school - private or public - can fix that. They can respond professionally and sensitively, and seek assistance where appropriate, but if the child does not excel, it does not mean that the school is an educational failure. To hold a high school maths teacher or even a principal responsible for the serious difficulties that some children are in by age 16 is as irrational as it is unfair.
